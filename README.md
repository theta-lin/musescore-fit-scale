# Musescore Plugin: Fit Scale

This plugin finds the closest diatonic scale to the selected notes (or the entire score if nothing is selected). It enumerates all the scales by the 12 tonal centers and the 7 Greek modes, then ranks them first by the percentage of notes in the scale and then by the percentage of notes that are the tonal center. It can also highlight the chromatic notes (notes not from the scale) when given a scale.

Supported version: 3.x
